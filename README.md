:computer: **`Software Engineer`**

As a fourth-year computer science student at Colorado State University Global, I have a strong foundation in a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++, and have completed relevant courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Software Engineering. Despite complex and accelerated coursework, and other challenges, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA and frequently conducted my own research and projects.

I have gained practical experience through my contributions to open source software, as well as my personal projects. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and have developed interest specifically in machine learning and artificial intelligence. From my machine learning projects, I have gained experience and overcome challenges in selecting and preprocessing data, choosing the right algorithm or model for the task, and fine-tuning model hyperparameters. 

In addition to programming languages, I have relevant experience with:
-Machine learning libraries and frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Pandas
-Cloud-based machine learning platforms: Google Cloud AI Platform and Amazon SageMaker
-Databases: NoSQL and Access

Overall, I am a dedicated and driven software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to excellence. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to a dynamic team and continue growing and learning as a professional.
